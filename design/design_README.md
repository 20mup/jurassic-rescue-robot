# 🧩 Design Files — Jurassic Rescue Robot

This folder contains all mechanical design files used for laser cutting, 3D printing, and assembling the robot chassis and modules.

## 📐 Files Overview

### 🖨️ 3D Printing
- `Ball_Caster.stl`  
  → 3D model of the rear omni-directional caster. Positioned at the rear center of the chassis to support two-wheel drive turning.

---

### 🧱 SolidWorks CAD Parts (`.SLDPRT`)
- `Front.SLDPRT`  
  → Front chassis wall for structural support and mounting  
- `back.SLDPRT`  
  → Rear panel of the chassis  
- `base.SLDPRT`  
  → Bottom panel of the robot where all components were mounted  
- `sides.SLDPRT`  
  → Side walls, included for structure and possible mounting of sensors or decorations

> All parts were designed with tight tolerances for laser cutting and easy alignment.

---

### ✂️ Laser Cutting
- `WheelWithDimensions.dxf`  
  → Cut-ready DXF file for the robot’s wheel design. Includes dimensioning to ensure fit on the motor shaft and smooth rotation. Final version fixed tolerance issues seen in cardboard prototype.

## 🛠️ Assembly Notes

- All chassis panels were laser cut from wood/acrylic sheets
- Ball caster was 3D printed and press-fitted into the chassis
- Fitment tolerances were fine-tuned after testing in earlier rounds
- Final design minimized unnecessary weight and maximized stability for both manual and autonomous modes

## 🧪 Design Iteration Summary

- 📦 Round 1: Initial designs built with cardboard for fit testing  
- ✏️ Round 2–3: CAD models refined using SolidWorks  
- 🖨️ Round 4–5: Final parts laser cut or 3D printed and tested on the gameboard
