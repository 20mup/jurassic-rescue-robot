## 🧠 Project Overview

This project challenged teams to build a robot for a Jurassic Park-themed gameboard. The robot's main tasks:
- Autonomously press a button to open a gate
- Manually rescue a doll (Ken) and deliver it to the helipad
- Bonus: corral dinosaur figures into a cage

Our final robot featured a dual mechanism: a **plow** for scooping and a **vertical clamp** for secure object retrieval, optimized for both speed and precision.

## 🔁 Design Round Reflections

### 🔹 Round 1: Concept Selection & Risk Assessment
- Brainstormed 5 mechanisms: plow, horizontal claw, frying pan, crane claw, and plow + vertical clamp
- Selected **Plow + Vertical Clamp** for versatility and simplicity
- Created a detailed FRDPARRC table and safety plan
- Prototyped designs using cardboard and began safety assessments

---

### 🔹 Round 2: Subsystem Development
- Learned to interface with motor drivers, servos, and ultrasonic sensors
- Measured all gameboard components and Ken
- Developed CAD for claw and chassis
- Built test circuits and began 3D printing wheels and laser cutting parts
- Identified tolerances and weaknesses in early prototypes

---

### 🔹 Round 3: Integration Begins
- Created full electrical schematic + power budget
- Wired encoders and developed PID motor control
- Combined all control code modules
- Integrated joystick/gamepad for manual control
- Assembled first physical robot with working electronics

---

### 🔹 Round 4: Autonomous Mode + Chassis Iteration
- Built new laser-cut + 3D printed chassis with better part tolerances
- Integrated all sensors and battery monitoring
- Switched between manual and autonomous modes using joystick control
- Tested robot on real gameboard; practiced navigation
- Refined claw design for reliable grip

---

### 🔹 Round 5: Final Testing & Competition Prep
- Implemented autonomous mode logic using ultrasonic sensors
- Merged all final code into single working build
- Final chassis iteration completed with tight motor fits
- Focused on closed-loop feedback performance and autonomous consistency
- Developed presentation and uploaded files for cutting

---

## 📊 Key Takeaways

- Learned how to use **Raspberry Pi Pico**, PWM, encoders, PID control, and servo logic
- Practiced **rapid iteration**, from cardboard to final laser/3D printed modules
- Used **Scrum** and weekly retrospectives to adjust goals, handle setbacks, and improve team dynamics
- Applied **sustainable design** principles by minimizing materials and optimizing energy use
- Balanced **precision + simplicity** under motor, size, and component constraints

---

## 💬 Team Reflections

- Team communication was consistent but could benefit from more mid-week meetings
- We grew stronger in emphasizing high standards, especially near the end
- Our confidence improved through troubleshooting and iteration
- Key lesson: always build in slack time for 3D printing, testing, and fallback planning
