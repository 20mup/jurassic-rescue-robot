# ü¶ñ Jurassic Rescue Robot ‚Äî Portfolio Case Study

## Overview

The Jurassic Rescue Robot was a semester-long robotics project where we designed, prototyped, and tested an autonomous and manually operated robot tasked with completing a Jurassic Park-themed rescue mission. The final robot could autonomously press a button to open a gate and manually retrieve a doll (Ken) from a pit while optionally corralling dinosaur figures.

## üí° Project Goals

* Build a robot capable of autonomous and manual operations
* Retrieve a figure (Ken) from a simulated pit
* Press a button autonomously to open a gate
* Optionally corral dinosaur figures for extra points
* Meet specific mechanical and electrical constraints

---

## üîß Engineering Constraints

* **Microcontroller**: Raspberry Pi Pico
* **Motor Limit**: Max 3 servo/DC motors
* **Fabrication**: Limited laser cutting and 3D printing
* **No prefab chassis**: Custom frame required
* **Manual & Autonomous**: Robot had to support both modes

## üõ† Design Process

### Round 1 ‚Äì Concept + Cardboard Prototypes

* Brainstormed multiple rescue mechanisms (plow, claw, scoop)
* Tested with cardboard mockups to visualize robot dimensions and lifting methods
* Identified the need for a vertically-oriented claw for pit retrieval

### Round 2 ‚Äì Electrical + Mechanical Foundation

* Integrated motor drivers, servo motors, and ultrasonic sensors
* Built initial CAD models for the chassis and 3D printed key components
* Created laser cut wheels and initial control logic for motors and sensors

### Round 3 ‚Äì Subsystems Integration

* Designed power budget and schematic
* Created and tested spherical rear wheel + motorized front wheels
* Combined code into one file with joystick control and encoder support

### Round 4 ‚Äì Prototype Testing + Sustainability

* Assembled full prototype chassis
* Created switching logic between autonomous/manual modes
* Implemented battery monitoring system
* Considered long-term sustainability: energy efficiency and minimal emissions

### Round 5 ‚Äì Competition Prep

* Developed autonomous logic to navigate using ultrasonic sensors
* Tested robot on the gameboard and refined performance
* Finalized presentation and documentation
